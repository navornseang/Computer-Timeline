      <h1>Motherboard Timeline</h1>
      <ul class="timeline">
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(Late 1970s/Early 1980s) - Early Motherboard Concepts</h3>
          <p>
            Early personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PC used simple
            motherboards, primarily to connect the CPU, memory, and basic
            input/output components. These laid the groundwork for future
            development.

        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(1981) - ISA Bus</h3>
          <p>
            The introduction of the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus in
            the IBM PC was a significant step. It provided a standardized way to
            add expansion cards for features like graphics, sound, and
            networking, directly influencing motherboard design.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(1984) - AT Form Factor</h3>
          <p>
            The introduction of the AT form factor standardized the physical
            dimensions and layout of motherboards, influencing case design and
            component placement for years to come. This brought a level of
            consistency to the industry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(1992) - PCI Bus</h3>
          <p>
            The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus significantly
            improved performance over ISA, becoming the new standard for
            high-speed expansion slots. This required new motherboard designs to
            accommodate the PCI slots and controllers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(1995) - ATX Form Factor</h3>
          <p>
            The ATX form factor revolutionized motherboard design with improved
            airflow, easier component installation, and standardized connectors
            for power and other peripherals. It remains the dominant form factor
            today.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(1997) - AGP Slot</h3>
          <p>
            The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) was a dedicated high-speed
            interface designed specifically for graphics cards, providing a
            direct link to system memory and requiring dedicated slots on
            motherboards.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(2004) - PCI Express</h3>
          <p>
            PCI Express (PCIe) replaced PCI and AGP, offering a much faster and
            more versatile serial interface. PCIe's adoption required
            significant changes to motherboard architecture and is the current
            standard.

        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>
            (2000s-Present) - Chipset Evolution (Northbridge/Southbridge to PCH)
          </h3>
          <p>
            The evolution from a two-chip chipset (Northbridge and Southbridge)
            to a single-chip Platform Controller Hub (PCH) integrated more
            functions onto the motherboard and streamlined system architecture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-item">
          <h3>(2010s-Present) - M.2 and NVMe Support</h3>
          <p>
            The introduction of M.2 slots and NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)
            support on motherboards enabled significantly faster storage
            solutions using compact SSDs, changing storage connectivity on
            motherboards.
