              .1990: Introduced as an improvement over standard DRAM.<br />
              .FPM allowed faster access to data within the same row by
              eliminating the<br />need for repeated row address inputs.<br />
              .It's Widely used in early PCs until the mid-1990s.

              *1994: EDO DRAM was developed as a successor to FPM.<br />
              *Enhanced performance by allowing the next memory address<br />
              to be accessed while reading the current one.<br />
              *It's popular in computers during the late 1990s.

              *Unlike earlier DRAMs, SDRAM synchronized with the CPU clock,<br />
              improving speed and efficiency.<br />
              *It's widely used from the late 1990s until it was replaced by DDR
              SDRAM.

              *Initially adopted in Intel's high-end Pentium 4 systems but was
              soon replaced<br />

              memory architecture.<br />
